Simulation of [Stochastic processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process).

# Goal
Serve as an extension of the [rand crate](https://crates.io/crates/rand) for sub-stochastic markovian processes.

# Main features

- Easy construction of Markov processes, including:
  - Finite/Infinite states
  - Discrete/continuous time
- Type agnostic
- Zero-cost abstraction

# Changelog

See [Changelog](https://github.com/saona-raimundo/markovian/blob/master/Changelog.md).
